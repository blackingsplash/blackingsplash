## Hello! 👋
Hello, I am <b>EllieMakesManyGames</b>, a Python and Lua developer. I like to discuss in Roblox development communities around Discord and I am currently working to get a programming certificate! Shoot me a DM in Discord if you want to discuss any special inqueries together. My handler is <i>@elliemakesmanygames</i>.

## More!
I am currently on the lookout to be commissioned in any Roblox game and am learning discord.js to make Discord bots! Sadly, currently, <b>I am not looking to invest nor look into other games.</b> I am mainly on the lookout to sponsor my own expeirences and help new developers. Have a great day and nice life!
